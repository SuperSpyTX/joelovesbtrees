# joelovesbtrees

This is my current work in progress Red/Black tree implementation.

Nothing exciting to see here, for now.

License is MIT.

## What Works

- Insertion of nodes (100% working).
- Deletion of nodes (all other cases fixed, not sure if theres more (99%)).

## Purpose

This was created to help me understand Red/Black binary search trees better,
but also it's for an upcoming 42 project I'm currently working on (malloc).
