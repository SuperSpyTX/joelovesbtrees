# joelovesbtrees

This is my current work in progress Red/Black tree implementation.

Nothing exciting to see here, for now.

License is MIT.

## What Works

- Insertion of nodes.

## Purpose

This was created to help me understand Red/Black binary search trees better,
but also it's for an upcoming project.
